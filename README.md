# TCP Port Scanner

## Description
This app probes a target server for active ports, and returns open port numbers, as well as additional information through TCP/IP fingerprinting. The user may specify a range of ports to scan. If no range is specified, ports 0-1024 are scanned. If one of the open ports is the default port for a specific network protocol, the protocol's name will be listed as well.
